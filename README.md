The tempescope is a physical display that can recreate various weather conditions (eg: rain, clouds, lightning) inside a box.
OpenTempescope is the open source version of tempescope.

The system is composed of three parts:
OpenTempescope- the box itself
Tempescope Demo App- an app that runs on your iOS device, and connects to OpenTempescope by BLE

For instructions on how to build a tempescope, see: https://github.com/kenkawakenkenke/tempescope/wiki

CONTENTS OF DISTRIBUTION:
tempescope:  contains source code for the OpenTempescope and Tempescope Demo App
hardware: contains the schematics, CAD data etc for the hardware

INSTALLATION:
- OpenTempescope/OpenTempescope
  load this sketch onto an ATMega328p and insert into your OpenTempescope.

- OpenTempescope/TempescopeController/TempescopeDemo
